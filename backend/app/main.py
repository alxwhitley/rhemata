# GHSA-82w8-qh3p-5jfq (CVE-2026-54283): starlette 0.52.1 forwards max_fields
# and max_part_size to the multipart parser but not to the urlencoded one, so
# request.form() on an urlencoded body is unbounded -- a single request can
# block this worker's event loop or force allocation proportional to its body.
# FastAPI parses the body (routing.py:366) BEFORE it solves dependencies
# (routing.py:416), so the admin gate on /ingest does not stand in front of it;
# the parse happens for an anonymous caller and the 401 arrives afterwards.
#
# No endpoint in this application accepts urlencoded input: /ingest is the only
# route declaring form fields and it requires multipart for its file upload.
# Refusing the content type outright therefore closes the exposure without
# touching the coupled fastapi/starlette pins that Invariant 14 warns about.
# Multipart is untouched and keeps its own enforced limits.
#
# Registered before security_headers so that middleware still stamps this
# response. It does sit inside CORSMiddleware, so the 415 carries no CORS
# headers -- acceptable, because no browser client here sends this type.
# Full triage: docs/audits/2026-09/starlette_advisory_triage_2026-09-05.md

# different origin, not HTML documents:
#   - X-Frame-Options / Referrer-Policy / Permissions-Policy are omitted --
#     they govern document framing and navigation, which JSON responses don't
#     do. CORS (above) is what actually restricts who may read these responses.
#   - Content-Security-Policy is omitted for the same reason.
#   - HSTS is included because this origin serves over HTTPS and, unlike the
#     Vercel-hosted frontend, nothing upstream adds it. includeSubDomains and
#     preload are left OFF on purpose: this is a *.up.railway.app hostname, so
#     asserting a policy over sibling subdomains (or entering the preload list)
